# Movie Recommender System
This is a machine learning project that implements a movie recommender system based on the TMDB dataset from Kaggle. The system utilizes collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized movie recommendations to users.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset, which can be found on Kaggle (link to dataset). It consists of movie metadata such as title, genre, cast, crew, and user ratings.

## Project Structure
### The project is structured as follows:
•	data/: This directory contains the dataset files (tmdb_5000_movies.csv and tmdb_5000_credits.csv).
•	notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
•	src/: This directory contains the source code for the movie recommender system.
•	requirements.txt: This file lists the Python libraries and their versions required to run the project.

## Installation
1.	Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/Shyamxyadav/movies_recommender_system.git
2.	Navigate to the project directory: cd movie-recommender-system
3.	Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
1.	Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks/ directory to explore the dataset, preprocess the data, train the recommender system, and evaluate its performance.
2.	Modify the configuration parameters in src/config.py to customize the behavior of the recommender system, such as the number of recommendations to generate and the similarity metric to use.
3.	Use the recommender system API in src/recommender.py to integrate the movie recommendations into your own applications.

## Results
The movie recommender system achieves an accuracy of XX% (or any relevant evaluation metric) in predicting user preferences and providing personalized recommendations. The performance may vary depending on the dataset and the chosen configuration.
Future Improvements

## Here are some potential areas for future improvements:
•	Implementing more advanced collaborative filtering techniques, such as matrix factorization or deep learning-based models.
•	Incorporating additional features or external datasets to enhance the recommendation quality.
•	Developing a user interface for a more user-friendly experience.
